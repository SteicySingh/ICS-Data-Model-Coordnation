# ICS-Data-Model-Coordnation
This project aims to expedite the initialization process of the ICS model (Information Competition Simulator by Advanced Research lab for Intelligence and Security) by processing source data files from the World Value Surveys and 3 other barometers (for region Morocco) . It involves pushing the required metadata as well as the actual file data into PostgreSQL tables.
