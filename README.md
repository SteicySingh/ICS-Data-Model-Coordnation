# ICS-Data-Model-Coordnation

ARLIS - 1 (out of 14) UARC in the US. ICS is project owned by ARLIS â€“ leading service model which simulates human behavior & sociotechnical complexity to enhance unit effectiveness & reduce risk in wargaming states.

This GITHUB project aims to expedite the initialization process of the ICS model(Information Competition Simulator by UMD Advanced Research lab for Intelligence and Security) by processing source data files from the World Value Surveys and 3 other barometers (for region Morocco) . It involves pushing the required metadata as well as the actual file data into PostgreSQL tables.

Earlier this process was heavily manual and very much time consuming.

After collaborating with stakeholders and performing gap analysis to find inefficiences, this solution was developed.
